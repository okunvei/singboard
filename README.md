## Tech Stack

- Frontend: `Vue 3`, `TypeScript`, `Vite`, `TailwindCSS`, `DaisyUI`, `ECharts`, `CodeMirror 6`
- Backend: `Rust`, `Tauri 2`
- Platform: currently focused on `Windows` (with Windows Service integration)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- `pnpm`
- Rust stable (recommended via `rustup`)
- Windows C++ Build Tools (MSVC)
- WebView2 Runtime

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run frontend only:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Run desktop app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Build

Build frontend:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Build desktop app:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

## Project Structure

```text

## Configuration and Data

- Default landing route: `/proxies`
- Runtime settings are persisted via in-app Settings (localStorage)
- Typical data directory: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\singboard\EBWebView\Default\`

## Notes

- This project depends on Clash API; make sure sing-box exposes a reachable API endpoint.
- The default Windows service name is `sing-box` and can be changed in Settings.
